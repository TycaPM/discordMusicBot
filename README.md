This is the code behind a discord bot that solves on simple problem.
That problem being that you need music in your vcs.

While you're most certainly welcome to invite the instance I host, 
if you would like to host your own, the .py contains everything you need
with all the listed functionality working as intended.

-play <yt-url>
-queue 
-skip
-skipto <song #>
-pause
-resume
-remove <song #>
-stop

All you need is to setup your own .env file and to configure it with your own
API tokens for discord and youtube data and you'll be good to go.
I look forward to adding new features such as spotify capabilities and more 
media controls, but this will get you from A to B. Enjoy! :D
